# Ongoing continual changes
- Keep the script updated for new Windows 11 changes from Microsoft.
- Improve stability and make behavior more consistent across different hardware.
- Fine‑tune tweaks to increase overall effectiveness while minimizing side effects.
- Adjust changes to affect all users where possible.


# Upcoming planned changes
- Script modifies timezone to MST, but I commented it out. Option to choose timezone instead of hard‑coding MST will be added soon.
