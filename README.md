# Cecil's Win11 Cleanup
This is my custom-made script for IT admins (or everyday users) that will cleanup, debloat, and optimize for performance. It works on Windows 10 but is designed for Windows 11. My goal here is to make a quick and easy way to fix annoyances and create a clean Windows experience.

> **Warning:** This script makes system and registry changes. Test it in a VM or non‑critical machine first, if worried. I use this multiple times per day, and through the years.

## What it does  
(See EXPLANATION_OF_MODIFICATIONS for more detail)

- **Basics**
  - Ensures it runs with admin rights 
  - Detects and shows Windows version/build
  - Runs with clean and clear output of changes / failures  

- **Performance boost**
  - Sets Num Lock on by default (desktops only)
  - Sync time to make sure it's accurate
  - Applies “performance” visual settings (quicker response times)  
  - Makes File Explorer open to “This PC” instead of recents
  - Cleans up cluttered context menus and Quick Access
  - Disables sleep/hibernation when plugged in (maintain availability for remote access)

- **Privacy & telemetry**
  - Blocks a large list of Microsoft telemetry/metrics endpoints via HOSTS file
  - Disables or reduces telemetry, CEIP, error reporting, and web/Bing search integration  
  - Turns off Start menu ads, tips, and other “consumer” content  
  - Tightens various privacy‑related registry settings for current and default profiles

- **Apps & bloat**
  - Optionally uninstalls and cleans up OneDrive  
  - Restores Windows Photo Viewer as an image viewer option
  - Removes various preinstalled shortcuts and promo links from the Start menu
  - Tweaks Office/Outlook defaults (prefer local save, disable forced “New Outlook” migration) when present

- **Safety**
  - Enables periodic registry backups
  - Saves a snapshot of key registry hives to a dated folder under `C:\Windows\System32\config\RegBack\`

## What it does *not* do

- Does **not** remove core Windows components or features required for normal operation.
- Does **not** install any third‑party software.
- Does **not** disable Windows Defender or other antivirus products.
- Does **not** join domains, enroll in MDM, or otherwise change identity/network configuration.
- Does **not** make irreversible changes without at least a basic registry backup in place.

That said, many changes are low‑level registry and policy tweaks. Always verify they match your environment’s requirements.
